# Go-Shopping-Poc-Ui
This project is the UI companion to the backend infrastructure and services being created in [go-shopping-poc](https://github.com/asptom/go-shopping-poc) (look in the develop branch for the latest)

This is a proof-of-concept/learning project intended to implement something with the latest version of Angular that exercises the backend services being created with Go.

This project will also be a test bed for using AI and AI Agents to help generate and evaluate code.

## Background

I previously built the back-end services in Java/Quarkus, but will be re-developing/improving them in Go in order to learn Go and try different techniques.

The UI that interfaced with those Java/Quarkus services was written in Angular v13.2 and interfaced with the services primarily using REST but also leveraged a Websocket for some communication.
